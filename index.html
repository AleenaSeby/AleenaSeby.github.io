    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Full-Stack Developer based in Calgary, Canada with over 7 years of experience building scalable
      and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in React.js, Vue.js, Node.js, GraphQL, and AWS, with a strong
      foundation
      in backend development using Python (Django), Express, and SQL databases.

      Currently expanding cloud expertise through AWS certification to strengthen enterprise solution capabilities and
      Generative AI courses to integrate AI into modern applications.

      I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Calicut and have worked across
      diverse industries including e-commerce, healthcare, and enterprise platforms. My recent work includes leading the
      migration of a high-traffic e-commerce platform to Contentful CMS and driving CI/CD automation as Release Captain.

      I'm passionate about writing clean, testable code, mentoring junior developers, and exploring emerging
      technologies — especially AI, GitHub Copilot, and machine learning to enhance modern software development.
